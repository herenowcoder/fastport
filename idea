fast graph processing: c, ocaml, clisp?
daemonize? if so, look for new directories - via kqueue?

Well don't overuse graph libs, solve immediate problem instead.
Using C or Ruby or whatever.

The current problem is:
portmaster -L is too slow (~12s on nebula, 16s when not in the cache).
Speed up!

Algo: for each package in /var/db/pkg/ check version in ports index.

Looks like checking unpacked dir for a specific port doesn't buy us
anything, as there's no guarantee exact version (with patchlevel etc)
will occur anywhere there.

Solution: 
A. Binary search of sorted ports index.
B. Brute grep for the line starting with package in the index.

Simply check if A is reasonably faster for the whole set of installed pkgs.


Yeah actually I need reverse index, mapping origin port to port name + ver. 
Sorted or not.
Thus I created revindex tool in C to quickly generate it from port index.
