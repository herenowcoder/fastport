fastport - utility for fast operations on FreeBSD ports index
========

This program takes an avantage of ports index file being sorted by a
port path and allows speedy binary search in it. Its main purpose is to
quickly check which ports may need upgrading (using -u switch). It is
done by scanning the installed packages in /var/db/pkg, extracting the
port path and binary-search the entry in the index file.

The other implemented mode of operation is to simply return a record
from ports index for a given port path (using -l switch).


Using this tool probably makes sense only for people not using
portupgrade and wanting something faster than `portmaster -L' to check
the ports for upgrading.  You can find the motivation behind this
little piece of code in the `idea' file.


Installation
============

make install


Summary of usage:

fastport -u		Show ports index entries whose versions differ from
	 		installed ones - they are candidates for upgrade.
fastport -l port_path	Show ports index entry for a port_path given as 
	    		'category/port_name'.
fastport -t		This is a regression test and a timing mesasure: 
	 		return result for every index entry found by a binary
			search. Should effectively give exactly the same output
			as the ports index file.
